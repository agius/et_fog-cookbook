## 1.0.5

* Install Git, as nokogiri (and thus fog) depend upon it for building native extensions

## 1.0.4

* Give up on apt compile time and do the update ourselves--the cookbook is not actually handling it

## 1.0.3

* Install the 'unf' Gem.

## 1.0.2

* Include the apt cookbook (to make sure update runs)
* Set compile time attributes in attributes instead

## 1.0.1

* First rev!
